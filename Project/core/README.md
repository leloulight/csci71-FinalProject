## Spawn a new app
Duplicate `sample-environment.ph` and `sample-app.com` outside of the `samples/` folder so that they're parallel to `core/`

Example:

    root/
      core/
      sample-environment.php
      sample-app.com

Then, rename `sample-environment.php` to `environment.php` and `sample-app.com` to whatever your app name is (ex, foobar.com).


Results:

    root/
      core/
      environment.php
      foobar.com

Finally, point your host/localhost to your app folder to begin.
